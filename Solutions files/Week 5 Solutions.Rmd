#1. Linear Regression using the faithful dataset
# look at the data in the base file
```{r}
str(faithful)
faithful
View(faithful)
```

# plot some pictures
```{r}
scatterplot(eruptions ~ waiting, data = faithful)
```

# Looks decent in terms of the boxplots - indicates normality and homogeneity of variance
# Maybe an issue with linearity of the response to explanatory but we'll have a look

# Using ggplot
```{r}
ggplot(faithful,aes(waiting,eruptions)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

# Specify and examine linear model
```{r}
summary(lm(eruptions ~ waiting, data = faithful))
anova(lm(eruptions ~ waiting, data = faithful))
```
# write the model to an object
```{r}
faithful.lm <- lm(eruptions ~ waiting, data = faithful)
```

# look at plots for validation
```{r}
op <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) 
plot(faithful.lm)
par(op)
```
# QQ-plot indicates normality
# residuals v fitted suggests limited heterogeneity that is a result of two clumps of points, but it the residuals are evenly spread either side of the zero line.
# Scale v location indicates homogeneity
# Leverage plot indicates a few issues. We'll leave it and come back to how to deal with this # in subsequent classes

# same plots in ggfortify

```{r}
autoplot(faithful.lm)
```

# Last validation task; plot residuals against explanatory
```{r}
plot(faithful.lm$resid ~ faithful$waiting,
     xlab = "Waiting time (mins)",
     ylab = "Model residuals")
```

# Generally fine so we'll go with it for the time being. 

# Decision will run with a linear model
#Â We'll revisit this in a week or so to run another regression technique later in the course
# plot model and add R-square etc
```{r}

     ylab = "Eruption duration (mins)",

# add the regression line from the model (faithful.lm) using abline.....
abline(faithful.lm, col="black")
# add the equation
text(99,2, "eruptions = 0.0756waiting + -1.874", pos = 2, cex=0.65)
# add r-square value
text(99,1.75, expression(paste(R^2 == 0.8108)), pos = 2, cex = 0.6) # add in text using the expression/paste functions
# create a sequence of 1000 number spanning the range of humidities (min to max)
x <- seq(min(faithful$waiting), max(faithful$waiting), l=1000)  # notice this is an 'l' = length. NOT a 1!!!!!!!
#for each value of x, calculate the upper and lower 95% confidence
y<-predict(faithful.lm, data.frame(waiting=x), interval="c")
#plot the upper and lower 95% confidence limits
matlines(x,y, lty=3, col="black") # This function add the CIs, lty = line type (dashed)

```
#  plot with ggplot
```{r}
p <- ggplot(faithful, aes(x=waiting, y=eruptions)) + 
  geom_point(col = "grey") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, col = "black") + 
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 50, y = 6,
           label = "Eruptions = -0.076Waiting + -1.87\nAdj. R2 = 0.8108",
           hjust = 0)
p + xlab("Waiting time between eruptions (mins)") + ylab("Eruption duration (mins)") + theme_bw()
```

# Predict and plot with ggplot

# add 'fit', 'lwr', and 'upr' columns to dataframe (generated by predict)
```{r}
old.predict <- cbind(faithful, predict(faithful.lm, interval = 'confidence'))
```
# plot the points (actual observations), regression line, and confidence interval

# 2. Mussel dataset using abundance as a response variable
# load data file
```{r}
Mussel <- read.csv(file.choose())
```
# Look at it
```{r}
glimpse(Mussel)
```

Plot it to check for linearity
```{r}
scatterplot(INDIV ~ AREA, data = Mussel)
```
# This indicates that the data are not normaly disributed (especially AREA)
# The abundance data don't look too good either. Huge peak in the middle
# might be outliers in both!!!!

# Let's fit a linear model nonetheless
```{r}
mussel.lm <- lm(SPECIES ~ AREA, data = Mussel)
# look at it
summary(mussel.lm)
```
# Area looks to significantly related to the number of mussels
# Now check assumption by using R's inbuilt model validation plot defaults
# set graphics parameters because we want all the plots on one graphic
```{r}
autoplot(mussel.lm)
```
# Residuals v Fitted indicate a problem. It's wedge shaped and humped!
# qqplot is a bit dodgy but might be okay
# Scale-Location plot indicates a wedge
# Cook distance / leverage looks okay - but there are some large values in area

# FINAL VALIDATION TASK - residuals against explanatory variable
```{r}
plot(mussel.lm$resid ~ Mussel$AREA,
     xlab = "Mussel bed Area", 
     ylab = "Residuals")
```
# Some code for ggplot to do the same thing.....
```{r}
ggplot(fortify(mussel.lm, Mussel), aes(AREA, .stdresid)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = TRUE)
```
# This indicates a few large values and a slight wedge due to numerous small patches
# Conclusion we reject the model

# So what do we do?
# We can linearise the explanatory variables by transforming them and re-run the model
# I am not a fan of this - we'll look at other approaches next week!
# and repeat the validation
# Let's fit a linear model nonetheless
```{r}
mussel.lm1 <- lm(SPECIES ~ log10(AREA), data = Mussel)
# look at it
summary(mussel.lm1)
```
# Now check assumption by using R's inbuilt model validation plot defaults
# set graphics parameters because we want all the plots on one graphic
```{r}
autoplot(mussel.lm1)
```
# Residuals v Fitted are better but there is still a bit of wedge at higher fitted values
# qqplot is a better
# Scale-Location plot indicates a slight wedge with higher values
# Cook distance / leverage looks improved

# FINAL VALIDATION TASK - residuals against explanatory variable
```{r}
ggplot(fortify(mussel.lm1, Mussel), aes(AREA, .stdresid)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
# This indicates a few large values and a slight wedge due to numerous small patches
# Conclusion we reject the model

# Try log10 on the response - not unusual with abundance data.
# There are no zeros so we don't need an offset of 0.01 or something similar
# Let's fit a linear model nonetheless
```{r}
mussel.lm2 <- lm(log10(INDIV) ~ log10(AREA), data = Mussel)
# look at it
summary(mussel.lm2)
```
# Now check assumption 
```{r}
autoplot(mussel.lm2)
```
# Residuals v Fitted are much better 
# qqplot is okay - slight issue on lower values
# Scale-Location plot is fine
# Cook distance / leverage looks okay

# FINAL VALIDATION TASK - residuals against explanatory variable
```{r}
ggplot(fortify(mussel.lm2, Mussel), aes(AREA, .stdresid)) +
  geom_point() 
```
# This is better but still a slight hump
# Conclusion we accept the model

# plot the final model in ggplot...
```{r}
p <- ggplot(Mussel, aes(AREA,INDIV)) + 
  geom_point(col = "grey") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, col = "black") + 
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1000, y = 30,

p + scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log10') + scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log10') + # These commands scale the axes
  annotation_logticks(sides="lb") # This adds log10 tick marks
```

#Plot the graph add equations in base R
```{r}

     xlab = "Log Mussel clump area (mm2)",
     ylab = "Log Number of Individuals",
     pch = 21, col = "grey", bg = "grey") # We've left the axes on
# add the regression line from the model (faithful.lm) using abline.....

# 3. ANCOVA on compensation dataset
# Just so you have a frame of reference going forward;
# the compensation data are about the production of fruit (apples, kg) 
# on rootstocks of different widths (mm; the tops are grafted onto rootstocks). 
# Furthermore, some trees are in parts of the orchard that allow grazing by cattle, 
# and others are in parts free from grazing. Grazing may reduce the amount of grass, 
# which might compete with the apple trees for resources.

# Load file
```{r}
Compensation <- read.csv(file.choose())
```
# look at data
```{r}
str(Compensation)
```

```{r}
Compensation$Grazing <- as.factor(Compensation$Grazing) # We need this to be a factor for an ANCOVA
```
Plot it
```{r}
# Plot it....
plot(Fruit ~ Root, data = Compensation, pch = 19,cex = 1.5,
     col = c("Black", "Red")[Compensation$Grazing],
     xlab = list("Root biomass (mm)", cex = 1.2),
     ylab = list("Fruit Production (kg)", cex = 1.2))
# Now add a legend
legend(5, 115, legend = c("Grazed", "Ungrazed"),
       col = c("black", "red"), pch = 19)
```

Or in coplot
```{r}
coplot(Root~ Fruit | Grazing, data =Compensation) # Grazed plants have higher root biomass. 

```
# You can do this is lattice too
```{r}
boxplot(Root ~ Grazing, data = Compensation) # These look fine
boxplot(Fruit ~ Grazing, data = Compensation)# These look fine
```
# You might also do some QQ-plots here.....or plot to check homogeneity of variances 
# but we'll leave that for validation....

# Run ANCOVA
```{r}
Compensation.lm <- lm(Fruit ~  Grazing*Root, data=Compensation) 
```
# Validate model to check assumptions
```{r}
autoplot(Compensation.lm)
```
# This looks pretty decent. Slight concern over QQ-plot but it's not a massive problem.

#Look at model outcomes
```{r}
anova(Compensation.lm)
```
# Anova shows that both Root and Fruit are significant terms
# But that the interaction isn't....

```{r}
summary(Compensation.lm) 
```
# Data indicate fruit differs by grazing 
# No interaction term i.e. slope for factor Grazing are the same
# Look at the example in the lecture 6 to figure out the intercept and slope differences, but here we go:

# The intercept (first row in the summary output) is the intercept for grazed samples because grazed (i.e G)
# comes before ungrazed (i.e. U) in the alphabet and R uses an alphanumeric call on factor data. 
# The 2nd line GrazingUngrazed is the difference in the intercepts. So Ungrazed is 30.806 larger. Meaning 30.8 more seeds are produced by grazed plants
# Calculate the intercept for Ungrazed
```{r}
-125.173  + 30.806 # = -94.367
```
# the third line is slope for root
# the fourth line GrazingUngrazed:Root is the difference in slopes between Grazed and Ungrazed = 0.756, which is tiny

# the coefficients show this....
```{r}
coef(Compensation.lm)
```
# Now lets add lines to the graphs. We can do it many ways - so here is another one!
# Route one - using abline
```{r}
plot(Fruit ~ Root, data = Compensation, pch = 19,cex = 1.5,
     col = c("Black", "Red")[Compensation$Grazing],
     xlab = list("Root biomass (mm)", cex = 1.2),
     ylab = list("Fruit production (kg)", cex = 1.2))
# Now add a legend
legend(5, 115, legend = c("Grazed", "Ungrazed"),
       col = c("black", "red"), pch = 19)
# add ablines....we'll do it manually using the slopes and intercepts but you can use coeff7() see below.
abline(-125.173, 23.240)
abline(-125.173+30.805, 23.240+0.756, col= "red")
```
# Plot using coefficients
```{r}
Compensation.lm$coeff[1] # regression coefficient for grazed intercept
Compensation.lm$coeff[2] # regression coefficient for grazed slope
Compensation.lm$coeff[3] # regression coefficient for diff in grazed/ungrazed intercept
Compensation.lm$coeff[4] # regression coefficient for diff in grazed/ungrazed slope
plot(Fruit ~ Root, data = Compensation, pch = 19,cex = 1.5,
     col = c("Black", "Red")[Compensation$Grazing],
     xlab = list("Root biomass (mm)", cex = 1.2),
     ylab = list("Fruit Production (kg)", cex = 1.2))
# Now add a legend
legend(5, 115, legend = c("Grazed", "Ungrazed"),
       col = c("black", "red"), pch = 19)
# add ablines....using coefficients - coeff()
abline(coef(Compensation.lm)[1], coef(Compensation.lm)[3]) 
# Now add the summer regression line
abline(coef(Compensation.lm)[1] + coef(Compensation.lm)[2],	
       coef(Compensation.lm)[3] + coef(Compensation.lm)[4],	
       col = "red")
```
# do some prediction....and plot....this is yet another way of doing it
#produce base plot 
```{r}
xs <- seq(0, 12, l = 100)
plot(Fruit ~ Root, data = Compensation, xlab = "Root biomass (mm)", ylab = "Fruit Production (kg)")
# Plot the points and predicted trends (using se)
points(Fruit ~ Root, data = Compensation, subset = Grazing == "Grazed", pch = 19)
pred <- predict(Compensation.lm, type = "response", se = TRUE, newdata = data.frame(Root = xs, Grazing = "Grazed", Root = mean(Compensation$Root)))
lines(pred$fit ~ xs)
points(Fruit ~ Root, data = Compensation, subset = Grazing == "Ungrazed", pch = 19, col = "red")
pred <- predict(Compensation.lm, type = "response", se = TRUE, newdata = data.frame(Root = xs, Grazing = "Ungrazed", Root = mean(Compensation$Root)))
lines(pred$fit ~ xs, col = "red")
legend("topleft", legend = c("Grazed", "Ungrazed"), pch = c(19, 19), col = c("red","black"), title = "Fruit Production", bty = "n")
box(bty = "l")
```
# Plot the points and predicted trends (using ggplot2). A fair bit easier.....NOTE - you'd need to tidy up the labels and the like...
```{r}
ggplot(Compensation, aes(x=Root, y=Fruit, color=factor(Grazing))) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm)
```
