# Preface

## **The class materials**

The class materials are written as a Quarto book which is renders to a sequence of linked html files and a PDF document. You need to click on the ‘index.html’ file to use it as a book - this will open up the list of chapters. 

The module is structured into 10 weeks of content, with each week introducing you to different aspects of using R to analyse environmental datasets. Chapter 10, or week 10, will introduce you to the datasets that you will use for Part A of the module assessment, which is worth 50% of overall the module mark.
