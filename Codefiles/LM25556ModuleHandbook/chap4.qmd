# Comparing groups: Means and related tests

Looking at this pattern it looks possible that the two factors might be interacting. We can check this, as we might do if we were planning to analyse the data using two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). We return to this in next week, but lets create a plot that visualises that. It's called an **interaction plot**.

```{r}
# --- Step 1: Create the summary data frame with ordered factors ---

Rye_summary <- Rye %>%
  # Convert 'Grazing' to a factor with a specific order
  mutate(Grazing = factor(Grazing, levels = c("Low", "Mid", "High"))) %>%
  
  # Group by both categorical variables
  group_by(Grazing, Field) %>%
  
  # Calculate the mean, count, standard deviation, and standard error
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_abund = mean(Abund),
    sd_abund = sd(Abund),
    sem = sd_abund / sqrt(n),
    .groups = 'drop' # Recommended to drop grouping after summarise
  ) %>%
  
  # Calculate the 95% confidence interval boundaries
  mutate(
    ic = sem * 1.96, # Interval of confidence
    upper_ci = mean_abund + ic,
    lower_ci = mean_abund - ic
  )


# --- Step 2: Create the interaction plot ---

ggplot(Rye_summary, aes(x = Grazing, y = mean_abund, group = Field, color = Field)) +
  
  # --- Add the error bars ---
  # This geom will draw the vertical lines for the confidence intervals
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci),
    width = 0.1,  # Width of the horizontal caps on the error bars
    linewidth = 0.8
  ) +
  
  # --- Add the lines connecting the means ---
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  
  # --- Add the points for the means ---
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  
  # --- Add labels, colors, and a clean theme ---
  labs(
    title = "Interaction of Grazing and Field Position on Mean Abundance",
    subtitle = "Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals",
    x = "Grazing Level",
    y = "Mean Abundance",
    color = "Field Position"
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)
```
